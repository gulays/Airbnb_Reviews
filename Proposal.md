# Analysis of Airbnb Reviews

## Question/Need

This project will explore Airbnb reviews to provide additional, more descriptive keywords/ filters to travellers so that they would find an Airbnb that fits their needs. The findings would reveal what Airbnb users most care about the house. In other words, I will explore which listings properties -neighboorhood, cleanliness, safety, house amenities and etc- lead to a good/bad experience based on overall customer reviews. Lastly, the analysis provide more insight beyond original numeric ratings.
 

## Data 

The data will be collected from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html) and cover over 30K listings in New York City, till September, 2021. 
The summary description of the dataset is as follows:
- Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments.
- Listings, including full descriptions and average review score (about 70 features).

## MVP Goal:

EDA and topic modeling.
